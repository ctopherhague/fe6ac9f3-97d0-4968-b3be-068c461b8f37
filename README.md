Approach:

Firstly, I completed the assignment using ES6 React classes and managing
state myself. I started to convert the application to Redux when I ran out
of time. 

Were I to continue I would complete the redux and functional declaration
work. I would also add appropriate unit tests, error handling, and better
document my work where appropriate. 

I'm not very passionate about CSS and UI tweaking so suffice to  say that
were I to continue past the stretch goals, it would involve middleware work, 
more redux patterns, End to End testing, hypermedia links (per the prompt) 
and other such work. 

Thank you for taking the time to review this submission.
